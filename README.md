# Hi, I'm Noah Boucher. <br>
I am a student at Old Dominion University in the Game Development and Criticism Major and will graduate in December of 2024. I recieved my Associate Degree in Computer Science at TCC in May 2023. <br>
I have the most experience with Unity, but have done some small, mostly edificaitonal projects in Unreal. I know C++, Java, and C# and have 2, 3, and 4 years of experience respectively.<br>
I have experience working on top-down, VR, first and third person games with one of my recent projects being done for VMASC's OERI at an internship over the summer of 2024. <br>
In my free time, I volunteer to assist the Virginia Four Wheel Drive Association's Fall Run and the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life Four Wheel Drive Event, typically held in the spring. Both of these events are private guided rides on Oak Ridge Estate.
In total, I have donated over 550 hours of my time since 2016 to repair trails, be a trail guide, and provide assistance for the propety owners with projects they want completed around the property. <br>
In the summer of 2019, I was one of 6 high school interns in the Tidewater area to be selected for a summer internship at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia, and was a part of the RF Engineering department. 
I worked on various projects asissting my mentor and the other employees of the RF Engineering Department with some of the projects now being a part of the particle accelerator's data collection. <br> 
I achieved my Eagle Scout rank in December of 2016 when I was in Boy Scouts of America, and my project was to install chain link fences totaling over 700 linear feet to complete the enclosure of the play field at Saint Matthew's Catholic School in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
I raised over $5000 to pay for materials and lead over 40 volunteers over two weekends to install the new fence. Sunbelt Rentals on Executive Blvd. in Chesapeake, Virginia donated over $400 in equipment rentals, 
Lowe's on North Battlefield Blvd. in Chesapeake assisted in purchasing the concrete for the posts,
and Hercules Fence in Norfolk, Virginia assisted me with the purchase of the fence materials and helpful additional information on how to install a chain link fence from their own experiences. <br>
