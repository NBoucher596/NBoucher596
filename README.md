## Hi, I'm Noah Boucher. <br>
I am a student at Old Dominion University in the Game Development and Criticism Major and will graduate in December of 2024 and I just finished an internship at the Virgnia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center (VMASC)! I recieved my Associate Degree in Computer Science at Tidewater Community College (TCC) in May 2023.  <br>
If I'm not doing schoolwork, I am either playing online with friends from high school, expanding my knowledge of 20th and 21st century history, or working on whatever interest I have at the moment. <br>

### Experience
- I have the most experience with Unity, but have done some small, mostly edificaitonal projects in Unreal. I know C++, Java, and C# and have 4, 3, and 2 years of experience respectively. <br>
- I have experience working on top-down, VR, first, and third person games from internships, class assignments, and projects made with my friends. <br>
### Projects Worked
- Monarch Odyssey <br>
- Awesome Possum <br>
- VMASC <br>
- The Last Tank <br>
- Jefferson Lab <br>
### Personal Acheivements
- I achieved my Eagle Scout rank in December of 2016 when I was in Boy Scouts of America, and my project was to install chain link fences totaling over 700 linear feet to complete the enclosure of the play field at Saint Matthew's Catholic School in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
I raised over $5000 to pay for materials and lead over 40 volunteers over two weekends to install the new fence. Sunbelt Rentals on Executive Blvd. in Chesapeake, Virginia donated over $400 in equipment rentals, 
Lowe's on North Battlefield Blvd. in Chesapeake assisted in purchasing the concrete for the posts,
and Hercules Fence in Norfolk, Virginia assisted me with the purchase of the fence materials and helpful additional information on how to install a chain link fence from their own experiences. <br>
- I volunteer to assist the Virginia Four Wheel Drive Association's Fall Run, held in September and the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life Four Wheel Drive Event, held in April. Both of these events are private guided rides at Oak Ridge Estate and I have donated over 550 hours of my time since 2016 to repair trails, be a trail guide, and complete owner requested projects around the property. <br>
